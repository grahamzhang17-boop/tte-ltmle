# Target Trial Emulation for Causal Inference Using Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation: An Application to Chronic Oral Diseases and Incident Dementia in the UK Biobank
This project uses a Target Trial (TTE) framework and Longitudinal Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (LTMLE) to estimate the impact of chronic oral disease exposure timing on the 25-year incident dementia risk.

My full abstract & research paper is attached in "tte-ltmle-paper"

## Overview
All analyses were conducted on the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP). As such, the code provided here is for demonstration only and cannot be run without access to restricted datasets.

The code is split into three sections within the programs folder:
- analysis -> run main ltmle analyses on processed data
- plotting -> generate plots of main analyses
- processing -> clean and process data

All code is my own; no code was aquired from external sources.
